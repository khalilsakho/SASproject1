# üîç Objective

This project explores the empirical relationship between educational attainment and earned income using a detailed dataset of demographic, socioeconomic, and regional variables. The core objective is to determine how different education levels and demographic factors (e.g., age, race, health, citizenship, marital status) influence annual earnings. The analysis uses SAS to generate insights through data visualization, statistical modeling, and regression analysis.

# üìé Tools Used

- **SAS 9.4** ‚Äì Primary tool for data import, cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization
- **PROC MEANS, PROC FORMAT, PROC SGPLOT, PROC REG** ‚Äì Key SAS procedures used
- **PDF Report** ‚Äì Final write-up including figures, interpretations, and model results
  
# üîß Data Manipulation and Cleaning

- **Feature Creation**:
  - *Import Data & Create a New Dataset*
```
DATA WORK.projdata1;
set e625data.cps_raw_sample;
```
  - *Create Race Variables*
```
	IF pehspnon eq 1 THEN hispanic = 1;
	ELSE IF pehspnon eq 2 THEN hispanic = 0;
	
	white = 0;
	black = 0;
	asian = 0;
	other = 0;
	
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 1 THEN white = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 2 THEN black = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 3 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 4 THEN asian = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 5 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND pratrace EQ 6 THEN black = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND pratrace EQ 7 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND pratrace EQ 8 THEN  asian = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 9 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 10 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 11 THEN asian = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND pratrace EQ 12 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 13 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 14 THEN other = 1;
	IF hispanic EQ 0 AND prdtrace EQ 15 THEN other = 1;

	* Add labels to variables;
   label White = "White = 1 if the person is white and is not Hispanic, and = 0 otherwise"; 
   label Black = "Black = 1 if the person is black and is not Hispanic, and = 0 otherwise";
   label Asian = "Asian = 1 if the person is Asian and is not Hispanic, and = 0 otherwise";
   label Other = "Other = 1 if the person is of another race and is not Hispanic";
   label Hispanic = "hispanic = 1 if the person is Hispanic regardless of race";
```

  - *Create Citizenship & Marital Status Variables*
```
   citizen = 0;
   if PRCITSHP ge 1 and PRCITSHP le 4 then citizen = 1;

   * Create marital status variables;
   married = 0;

   else if A_MARITL = 6 then separated = 1;
   else if A_MARITL = 7 then never_married = 1;

   * Add labels to variables;
   label citizen = "= 1 if citizen; = 0 otherwise"; 
   label married = "= 1 if married; = 0 otherwise";
   label widowed = "= 1 if widowed; = 0 otherwise";
   label divorced = "= 1 if divorced; = 0 otherwise";
   label separated = "= 1 if separated; = 0 otherwise";
   label never_married = "= 1 if never_married; = 0 otherwise";
```
  - *Create Sex Variables*
```
	*Used the CPS variable A_SEX to create a variable called female = 1 for females and = 0 for males*;

	* Create female variable*;
	*Female =1 Male =0*;

	Female = 0;
	If A_Sex = 2 Then Female = 1;
	label Female = 'female = 1 for females and = 0 for males';
```
  - *Create a variable called earned_income that is equal to PEARNVAL*\
	*Create a variable called Annual_Hours that is equal to usual hours per week X number of weeks worked*\
	*Create a variable called hourly_wage that is equal to Earned_Income/Annual_Hours*;
```
	Earned_Income = PEARNVAL;
	Annual_Hours = HRSWK * WKSWORK;
	Hourly_Wage = Earned_Income / Annual_Hours;
